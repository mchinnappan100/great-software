The **primary authors of UNIX** are:

## ✅ **Ken Thompson** and **Dennis Ritchie**

They created UNIX at **Bell Labs** in the late **1960s–early 1970s**.

### Who did what (in a nutshell):

* **Ken Thompson**

  * Wrote the **first version of UNIX** (1969)
  * Designed many core UNIX concepts (files as streams, pipes, simple tools)
* **Dennis Ritchie**

  * Created the **C programming language**
  * Rewrote UNIX in **C**, which made it portable and changed computing forever

### Important collaborators (worth knowing):

* **Brian Kernighan** – documentation, tooling, and co-author of *The C Programming Language*
* **Douglas McIlroy** – pipes, UNIX philosophy (“do one thing well”)
* **Joe Ossanna** – early tooling (e.g., `troff`)
* **Rob Pike** (later era) – Plan 9, Go, carried UNIX ideas forward

### Why this matters

Rewriting UNIX in **C** was the secret sauce—it allowed UNIX to spread across hardware platforms, directly influencing:

* Linux
* BSD
* macOS
* iOS / Android internals
* Pretty much every modern OS philosophy

In short:

> **Ken Thompson invented UNIX.
> Dennis Ritchie made it portable—and timeless.**
