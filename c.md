The **C programming language** was created by **Dennis Ritchie**.

A few quick nuggets:

* 👨‍💻 **Author:** Dennis Ritchie
* 🏢 **Where:** Bell Labs
* 📅 **When:** Early 1970s (around 1972)
* 🐧 **Why it mattered:** C was designed to build **UNIX**, and UNIX was largely rewritten in C

And the ripple effect is wild:

* C directly influenced **C++**, **Objective-C**, **Java**, **C#**, **Go**, and many more
* It set the tone for what a “systems language” looks like even today

If Emacs had a founding father and C had one too, Dennis Ritchie is absolutely in the programming hall of legends 🙂
