**Emacs** was originally written by **Richard Stallman**.

He created the first version in **1976** while working at the **MIT AI Lab**. Later, Stallman rewrote it almost entirely as **GNU Emacs** (released in **1984**), which became a flagship project of the **GNU Project** and a cornerstone of the free software movement.

Quick hits:

* 👨‍💻 **Author:** Richard Stallman
* 🏛 **Origin:** MIT AI Lab
* 🐃 **Major version:** GNU Emacs
* 🆓 **Philosophy:** Free software (users can run, study, modify, and share)

Fun fact: Emacs is often jokingly called an *operating system* — it just happens to include a text editor. 😄
