**JavaScript was created by *Brendan Eich*.**

Quick facts:

* 👨‍💻 **Creator:** Brendan Eich
* 🏢 **Company:** Netscape
* 📅 **Year:** 1995
* ⏱ **Fun (and famous) detail:** The first version was written in **about 10 days**

Originally called **Mocha**, then **LiveScript**, it was renamed **JavaScript** mostly for marketing reasons (to ride Java’s hype at the time 😅).

Why it mattered:

* Brought **interactivity to the web**
* Now runs everywhere: browsers, servers (Node.js), mobile, desktop, even databases
* Powers frameworks like React, Angular, Vue, and more

Brendan Eich later went on to:

* Co-found **Mozilla**
* Create **Firefox**
* Co-found the **Brave** browser
